An excuse to do some 3D modelling of the earth.

Takes a list of points on the earth plus a list of connections
between the points.  Uses the haversine formula to compute
bearing and distance on the earth.  Allows alternate rendering
via AE (azimuthial equidistance) for 'flat earth'.

Also, a single text page flat earth challenge using the same
points and connections from the 3D model.
